We are currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here is the issue text:
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
sqlmigrate wraps it's outpout in BEGIN/COMMIT even if the database doesn't support transactional DDL
Description
	 
		(last modified by Simon Charette)
	 
The migration executor only adds the outer BEGIN/COMMIT ​if the migration is atomic and ​the schema editor can rollback DDL but the current sqlmigrate logic only takes migration.atomic into consideration.
The issue can be addressed by
Changing sqlmigrate ​assignment of self.output_transaction to consider connection.features.can_rollback_ddl as well.
Adding a test in tests/migrations/test_commands.py based on ​an existing test for non-atomic migrations that mocks connection.features.can_rollback_ddl to False instead of overdidding MIGRATION_MODULES to point to a non-atomic migration.
I marked the ticket as easy picking because I included the above guidelines but feel free to uncheck it if you deem it inappropriate.

--- END ISSUE ---

We also have a fail to pass unit test for the given issue. We can use this to help identify and fix the issue. Here is the patch text:

Please first localize the bug based on the issue statement, and then generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to fix the issue.

Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
1. The file path
2. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
3. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
4. The dividing line: =======
5. The lines to replace into the source code
6. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE

Here is an example:

```python
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Please note that the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION. If you would like to add the line '        print(x)', you must fully write that out, with all those spaces before the code!
Wrap the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit in blocks ```python...```.

Based on the issue description and the provided patch, it is clear that the problem lies in the `sqlmigrate` command not considering whether the database supports transactional DDL when deciding whether to wrap its output in `BEGIN/COMMIT` statements.

Here's the required `SEARCH/REPLACE` edit to `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py` to fix the issue:

This change ensures that `self.output_transaction` is set to `True` only if the migration is atomic and the database supports transactional DDL.

To verify:
1. The `self.output_transaction` assignment now takes both `migration.atomic` and `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` into account.
2. The provided patch for the test file already covers the cases where the database does and does not support transactional DDL, ensuring the fix works correctly.
