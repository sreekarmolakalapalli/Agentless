Here is the issue text:\n--- BEGIN ISSUE ---\nsqlmigrate wraps it's outpout in BEGIN/COMMIT even if the database doesn't support transactional DDL\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Simon Charette)\n\t \nThe migration executor only adds the outer BEGIN/COMMIT \u200bif the migration is atomic and \u200bthe schema editor can rollback DDL but the current sqlmigrate logic only takes migration.atomic into consideration.\nThe issue can be addressed by\nChanging sqlmigrate \u200bassignment of self.output_transaction to consider connection.features.can_rollback_ddl as well.\nAdding a test in tests/migrations/test_commands.py based on \u200ban existing test for non-atomic migrations that mocks connection.features.can_rollback_ddl to False instead of overdidding MIGRATION_MODULES to point to a non-atomic migration.\nI marked the ticket as easy picking because I included the above guidelines but feel free to uncheck it if you deem it inappropriate.\n\n--- END ISSUE ---\n\nWe also have a fail to pass unit test for the given issue. We can use this to help identify and fix the issue.
